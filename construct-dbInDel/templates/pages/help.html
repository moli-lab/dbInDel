                <p>dbInDel is the first database presenting bona fide InDels in putative enhancers for 254 human and 21 murine cell line/tissue samples, which can be visualized in an interactive manner and are downloadable. Along with InDels detected, the database predicts potentially recruited transcription factors because of binding motifs caused by InDels. In addition, dbInDel incorporates annotation of InDel-assigned genes, together with their expression profiles in normal and cancer cells/tissues as well as survival analysis. The discovery of enhancer-associated InDels provides a foundation for investigation of the functional contributions of this class of variants across a broad spectrum of human diseases. More importantly, enhancer-associated InDels may reveal a new means to implicate potential targets for therapies and diagnostic approaches that empower precision medicine.</p>

                <p>Although only a few driver noncoding mutations have been identified and validated (Horn et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2013; Mansour et al., 2014; Rahman et al., 2017), these findings strongly suggest that somatic noncoding mutations which contribute to tumor biology also occur in gene regulatory elements. Identification of InDels from sequencing reads of H3K27ac ChIP-Seq, which are generated predominantly from active regulatory domains, provides a direct link between the variants and their putative function in regulating gene expression. Importantly, dbInDel further analyzes binding motifs caused by InDels and predicts transcription factors potentially recruited, thereby providing mechanistic predictions of the functions of these enhancer-associated variants. </p>

The left panel of the Browse page is organized for sample filtering based on species, biosample types and caner types. “Search” box can also be used to locate the samples of interest. By clicking the sample name, the InDel information, sorted by coverage-biasing InDels, will be displayed as an interactive table. Further clicking an InDel will open a new tab showing sample information, general description of the InDel-assigned gene including: i) crosslink of drug-gene interaction database; ii) potential roles in human cancers which are integrated from COSMIC database, a most recent TCGA Pan-Cancer analysis entitled “Comprehensive Characterization of Cancer Driver Genes and Mutations”, as well as PubMed ID`s crosslink of GWAS studies. Notably, users can interactively visualize the enhancers and InDels based on sequencing reads of H3K27ac ChIP-Seq and potentially-recruited transcription factors because of binding motifs caused by InDels. In addition, gene expression profiles in normal and cancer cells/tissues and survival plots are displayed.
